# Sidebar Navigation Menu (HTML & CSS)

## Project Overview
This project is a beginner-level mini project developed as part of the **Apna College Sigma 9.0 Web Development Course**.

The task was to build an interactive **sidebar navigation menu** on a demo webpage with a camera background image, using **only HTML and CSS**, without any JavaScript. The main objective was to understand CSS-based interactivity, layout structuring, and transitions.

## Core Concept
### Sidebar Toggle Using Pure CSS

The sidebar open and close functionality is implemented entirely using CSS through:
- An invisible `input[type="checkbox"]`
- `label` elements linked to the checkbox
- Hamburger (☰) and close (✖) icons
- The `:checked` pseudo-class
- CSS sibling selectors (`~`)
- Smooth transition effects

This approach eliminates the need for JavaScript while maintaining full interactivity.

## Features Implemented (Course Requirements)
- Sidebar navigation menu with open and close icons
- Smooth sliding animation using CSS transitions
- Hover effects on menu items and icons
- Font Awesome icons integration
- Full-screen background image layout
- Clean structure using fixed and absolute positioning
